		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>My name is Joseph Altareb, and I'm a Student @ SFSU. I am studying Computer Science. This subject has captivated me since an early age and I've been blessed to be around computers and had the green light to tinker and experiment with the devices around me. <br />
		I want to work for a respectable company in the field, keeping my options open by participating in many clubs in different fields.
