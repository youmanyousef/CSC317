## Claude Prompt — “Joseph Altareb Portfolio ”

You are a front-end developer. Build a single-page responsive portfolio website for Joseph Altareb using the following exact specifications.

The goal is to visually make the layout look as professional as possible — do not require any reference image.

The design must be elegant, balanced, professional, and personal.

## VISUAL THEME & LAYOUT

Overall Style:

Clean, modern, and minimalistic.

White background for the hero and content sections.

Bright, multi-colored navigation bar beneath the hero (each tab a different color).

Strong typography contrast — large bold name, light subtitle, delicate cursive for the greeting.

Rounded edges and gentle shadows to create depth.

## Hero Section (top):

Split layout using Flexbox — left for text, right for portrait.

Left side:

A small line in cursive font: Hello, I am

Below it, large bold text: Joseph Altareb

Subtitle (smaller uppercase): COMPUTER SCIENCE STUDENT

Short paragraph: SFSU student who loves building things and learning across stacks.

Right side:

Portrait image placeholder (/assets/joseph-portrait.jpg) inside a rounded rectangle with soft drop shadow.

Center everything vertically.

White background, plenty of margin and padding.

Navigation Bar (below hero):

Full-width horizontal bar.

Tabs:

About Me (yellow)

Skills (orange)

Experience (red)

Each tab is a solid block of color with white uppercase text.

Fixed position at top once scrolling begins (sticky nav).

Smooth scroll to anchors.

## CONTENT SECTIONS

Each section is centered in a white card with a soft shadow and rounded corners.
Max width: 1000px, with consistent spacing and margins.
