#AI-2 CSS Prompt - Fall theme

I want to make a fall themed style for my prompt. I want to have the colors brown, orange, red, and black. 
The background should be black and the text should be brown and red. I want the titles to be larger and bold 
to stand out and I want all the text centered.

For the section titles the should be surrounded by a long box with an orange background and be 3 times the size of the text. 
Lists shouldn't have bullet points but instead have a small underline beneath each item. And the links should turn red when you hover over them.
