# AI-1 CSS Prompt – Halloween Theme

I want you to make a CSS style Halloween theme for my HTML file. 
Use the colors orange and black. The background should be mostly black, and include the buttons 
and other things like headers to be orange. Use a bold built-in font that looks good for the theme 
like Arial. Make it look semi-professional but also somewhat casual, and center everything so that it looks neat. 

Make the navigation buttons be on the top left, those don't need to be centered. 
Make them animated so that whenever you hover over them they jump up a bit, 
kind of like they're being startled by the mouse button. Do the same for the theme switcher buttons, 
and center those with a square box around them as the button. 

Each section should have a big rounded box around it like a grid, 
but instead of having multiple boxes next to each other, it’s just one big section at a time. 
The overall design should look clean, spooky, and fit the Halloween theme.
