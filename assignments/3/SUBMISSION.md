### [Member 3 Name] - AI Text Prompt CSS
[Individual reflection on AI prompting experience and lessons learned]

We learned how you have to be very specific with what you want if you use an AI to generate something for you. If you aren't
specific enough, the AI will just go off and do what it "thinks" you might want, which can end up something completely different. Being descriptive with what you want and how you want it makes a big difference as the AI will otherwise add a bunch
of unnecessary effects or code. While AI is effective at generating an idea quickly, it will still require a humans creative touch to refine ad adjust the results. This helped us understand how important clear communication is when working with AI tools and in general.

### [Member 4 Name] - AI Image+Text Prompt CSS (if applicable)

## Group Preferred Version
[Explain which version the group prefers and why - this should be a consensus decision]


## Collaboration Experience
[Describe how the group worked together, challenges faced, and lessons learned about teamwork]

We started out by deciding what each of us would do, and we divided the tasks between us. We communicated through Discord and helped each other whenever there was something we didn't understand. We had to get used to staying up to date with the repository so we wouldn't overlap each other's work. We learned how important clear communication and planning are when working as a team, especially when using shared tools like GitHub. Overall, it was a good experience working together as a team and seeing our contributions come together.
