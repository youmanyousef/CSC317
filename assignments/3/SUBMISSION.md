# Portfolio Styling Assignment Analysis

## Group Analysis (250-500 words)
[Write a collaborative analysis comparing the different approaches. Each member should contribute to this section.]

While working with each other we weren't always on the same page, for the most part we were unsure on what exactly we wanted and how we wanted it to look. The three different approaches while done in different orders helped inspire us on what we should do so we would all feel satisfied with our final results. We felt that the hand-written version gave us the most control where we could decide exactly what it is we wanted. It allowed us to design each section exactly how we imagined it and ensure everything matched the design we came up with. However this freedom we got was the most time-consuming of all the approaches as we had to manually change every detail to fit what we wanted. The AI generated one allowed us to get ideas quickly and experiment with different styles. While the AI was fast it was not always precise. This caused us to be left with a code that could use more, or had too much. For the price of that freedom we get from the hand-written approach, we get quick ideas. Unfortunately it would still need a human touch to make it fit our visions. The Hybrid combined the best parts of both approaches. We were able to use the quick ideas from the AI, and refine them manually to keep them consistent with what we wanted. This approach balanced creativity and structure together. While AI can help us gain inspiration and speed up the process, hand-written code is still important to ensure quality, accuracy and keeping the final design balanced.


## Individual Reflections

### [Member 1 Name] - Hand-written CSS (Part 1)
[Individual reflection on lessons learned and contribution to hand-written CSS]

While working on the hand-written section I had to take into consideration what my teammates might do, or what they might want to change. Because of this, I tried to keep the layout simple enough that it would be easy to change to match with the rest of the team. I learned how if I'm not a team player while thinking of what to do, it won't affect just me but my teammates as well. Everything needed to be kept flexible enough to change afterwards, nothing was set in stone until the final product. I tried experimenting with some hover animations, and ended up making a sort of "buzz-out" effect on the buttons. Overall, this helped me get a bit more comfortable writing out CSS from scratch and helping me memorize some stuff.

### [Aldo Navarro] - Hand-written CSS (Part 2)
[Individual reflection on lessons learned and contribution to hand-written CSS]

We learned that coordinating wasn't as simple as we thought it would be. While using discord does make contact easier our schedules conflicted. However, we all still came together to finish the project (which in truth we expected to turn in on sunday) and our communication has gotten better. The handwritten part was a bit of a challenge because when we started merging code we had different approaches to our designs. Plus, this was our first group project so we didn't even have prior experience working together. But I think that being able to see different styles helps us gain more perspective and will help us work together better in the future.

### [Member 3 Name] - AI Text Prompt CSS
[Individual reflection on AI prompting experience and lessons learned]

We learned how you have to be very specific with what you want if you use an AI to generate something for you. If you aren't
specific enough, the AI will just go off and do what it "thinks" you might want, which can end up something completely different. Being descriptive with what you want and how you want it makes a big difference as the AI will otherwise add a bunch
of unnecessary effects or code. While AI is effective at generating an idea quickly, it will still require a humans creative touch to refine ad adjust the results. This helped us understand how important clear communication is when working with AI tools and in general.

## Group Preferred Version
[Explain which version the group prefers and why - this should be a consensus decision]


## Collaboration Experience
[Describe how the group worked together, challenges faced, and lessons learned about teamwork]

We started out by deciding what each of us would do, and we divided the tasks between us. We communicated through Discord and helped each other whenever there was something we didn't understand. We had to get used to staying up to date with the repository so we wouldn't overlap each other's work. We learned how important clear communication and planning are when working as a team, especially when using shared tools like GitHub. Overall, it was a good experience working together as a team and seeing our contributions come together.
